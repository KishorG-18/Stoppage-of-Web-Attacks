Title
Stoppage of Web Attacks Using Machine Learning Techniques

Description
The project titled "Stoppage of Web Attacks Using Machine Learning Techniques" focuses on developing an intelligent system to detect and prevent 
web-based attacks such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), and phishing. Traditional rule-based security systems often 
struggle to handle evolving and zero-day threats, making machine learning a promising alternative. This project leverages publicly available datasets like CICIDS2017, UNSW-NB15, or
 the CSIC HTTP dataset to train and evaluate models. Key stages include feature selection to identify relevant patterns in web traffic, and the implementation of various 
machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and deep learning models like LSTM or CNN. These models are assessed using standard metrics such 
as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. The ultimate goal is to integrate the trained model with a web application or backend system to classify and block 
malicious requests in real time, thereby enhancing the security posture of web platforms.

Objectives:
To identify and classify various types of web attacks.
To build ML models that can learn from historical attack data and generalize to detect unknown threats.
To compare the performance of multiple ML algorithms in detecting web attacks.
To integrate the model with a web application firewall (WAF) or backend for real-time protection.

Key Components:
Dataset: Use of public datasets such as CICIDS2017, UNSW-NB15, or CSIC HTTP Dataset that contain labeled web traffic data.
Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant network and application-layer features for accurate detection.

ML Algorithms: Implementation of algorithms like:
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Gradient Boosting
Deep Learning models (e.g., LSTM, CNN for sequential HTTP request data)
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
Deployment: Optional integration with Flask/Django or Node.js-based backend to intercept and classify incoming HTTP requests.

Expected Outcome:
A machine learning-based web attack detection model capable of accurately classifying and preventing malicious
traffic, thus significantly reducing the risk of web-based exploits.
